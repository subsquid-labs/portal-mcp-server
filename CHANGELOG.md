# Changelog

## [0.7.6] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Added `portal_hyperliquid_get_ohlc` for trade-fill OHLC candles on `hyperliquid-fills`.
- Added chart-oriented OHLC output with `chart.kind: "candlestick"`, volume metadata, and automatic interval selection for common durations.

### Fixed
- Fixed Hyperliquid filtered stream walking so empty intermediate chunks do not stop later matching ranges from being scanned.
- Improved Hyperliquid OHLC backfill logic so chart windows are covered more reliably for longer durations.

### Changed
- Updated Hyperliquid docs and live tool-manifest coverage for the new OHLC tool.
- Bumped release version to `0.7.6`.
